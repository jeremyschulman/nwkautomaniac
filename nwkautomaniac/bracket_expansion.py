    Returns a generator that will yield string-replacements of
    pattern given the bracket notation.  Bracket notation is

        [<start>-<stop>,<step>]         # step is caller defined

    For example:
        # create 'ifs' as a generator for even numbered
        # ports on two different linecards:

        ifs = bracket_expansion('ge-[0-1]/0/[0-47,2]')

    # into the pattern on each iteration.  the technique is to make
    # each replacement value (originally a tuple) into a list.
    # this makes it pop'able.  so (1,2) becomes [1,2] so we can pop
    # values off the fron as the re.sub function iterates through
    # the string, yo!
